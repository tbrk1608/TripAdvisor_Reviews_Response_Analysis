# Trip Advisor Reviews - Response Analysis

Review websites such as TripAdvisor can have a significant impact on how travellers choose their accommodation. Most of the time, the consensus is what people will accept so it’s vital that a hotel has a reputation for quality service and professional standards. 

A recent Barclays study reveals there is an extra £3.2 billion to be earned over the next decade if the hotel sector becomes more attentive to online reviews. This is because customer reviews are a great source of “Voice of the customer” and could offer tremendous insights into what customers like and dislike about a product or service.

Considering the facts above, since customer reviews are detailed texts, it is an arduous task to generate insights from texts on a large scale. In this project, we introduce and apply some techniques to help companies in analysing the reviews efficiently.

Our Objectives:
We have shortlisted 2 main objectives that will help us to analyse the reviews and responses
1. Understand the emotions of the reviewers & build a model to determine the criticality of a review with the newly generated emotion as a feature.
2. Compare the review and responses to understand whether the reviews were addressed correctly.
